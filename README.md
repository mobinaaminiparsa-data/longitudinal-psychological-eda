# Exploratory Data Analysis of Longitudinal Psychological Data

## Project Overview
This project focuses exclusively on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of longitudinal psychological data. The goal is to investigate within-individual changes over time and explore variability patterns without applying predictive modeling techniques.

## Objectives
- Examine temporal trends across repeated measurements
- Analyze within-individual and between-individual variability
- Identify potential behavioral patterns over time
- Assess data quality and missingness structure

## Methods
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Missing Value Analysis
- Descriptive Statistics
- Visualization of Individual Trajectories (Spaghetti Plots)
- Group-level Mean Trend Analysis
- Distribution Analysis over Time (Boxplots / Density Plots)

## Key Insights
- Detection of heterogeneity in psychological responses
- Identification of temporal fluctuation patterns
- Understanding variability structures in longitudinal measurements

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Conclusion
This exploratory analysis provides foundational insights into the structure and dynamics of longitudinal psychological data and prepares the dataset for potential future modeling.
